# CAPE-KG
**Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Knowledge Editing Framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering**
## Overview
CAPE-KG, Consistency-Aware Parameter-Preserving Editing with Knowledge Graphs, a novel consistency-aware framework for PPKE on MHQA. CAPE-KG ensures KG construction, update, and retrieval are always aligned with the requirements of the MHQA task, maintaining coherent reasoning over both unedited and edited knowledge.

## Contributions
* The multi-layer KG architecture ensures the consistent knowledge boundary between factual and edited knowledge during PPKE.
* The case-isolated updating mechanisms with conflict arbitration guarantees edits are applied atomically and align with the case-isolated assumption.
* The edit-aware retrieval module with progressive strategies and edit-related retrieval routing ensures the retrieval process is always consistent with the intended KE.

## Datasets
Experiments are conducted on benchmark MQuAKE, includes MQuAKE-CF-3K and MQuAKE-T used for evaluation. Few-shot question decomposition demos are drawn from MQuAKE-CF after removing overlaps with the evaluation data, and the progressive retrieval
parameters are selected via grid search on it.
