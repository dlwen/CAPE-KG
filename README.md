*CONSISTENCY-AWARE PARAMETER-PRESERVING KNOWLEDGE
EDITING FRAMEWORK FOR MULTI-HOP QUESTION ANSWERING*
## Overview

## Contributions
## Datasets
Experiments are conducted on benchmark MQuAKE, includes MQuAKE-CF-3K and MQuAKE-T used for evaluation. Few-shot question decomposition demos are drawn from MQuAKE-CF after removing overlaps with the evaluation data, and the progressive retrieval
parameters are selected via grid search on it.
