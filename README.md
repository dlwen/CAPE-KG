# CAPE-KG

Main Contributions are:
We introduce a multi-layer KG architecture ensuring the consistent knowledge boundary between factual and edited knowledge during PPKE.
We design case-isolated updating mechanisms with conflict arbitration that guarantee edits are applied atomically and align with the case-isolated assumption.
We present an edit-aware retrieval module with progressive strategies and edit-related retrieval routing, ensuring the retrieval process is always consistent with the intended KE.
Extensive experiments on the MQuAKE benchmark demonstrate that CAPE-KG consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving substantial gains in consistency and accuracy across backbones.
